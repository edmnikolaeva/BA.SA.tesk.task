# Test Assignment – System & Business Analysis

This repository contains my solutions for the test assignment as a **System & Business Analyst**.  
The tasks include **process modeling, requirement specification, and API design**.



## ⚡ Key Points on Test Assignment Structure

### **Task 1 – BPMN**
The BPMN model reflects the workflow as described in the task, including noted questions and inconsistencies / [BPMN Diagram](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/BA.SA.tesk.task/blob/main/задани1.jpg)

### **Task 2 – User Story / Use Case**
Use Cases and User Story follow with clear actors, preconditions, acceptance criteria and scenarios.  
An optional process diagram is included / [Task2](https://github.com/edmnikolaeva/BA.SA.tesk.task/blob/main/BA.SA.test.task.by.NikolaevaED.pdf)

### **Task 3 – User Registration API**
